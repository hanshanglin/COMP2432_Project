# COMP2432_Project

## Input(part 1):
1. add details (duration,subject,priority,etc)
2. assign an ID
3. record `"accepted"` or `"rejected"` in a log file base on algorithms (in S3_XXX.log)

## Kernel(part 2):
  using a scheduler to generate timetables.  
  (implement some scheduling algorithms)

## Output(part 3):
print out time table

## Analyze(part 4):
generate a summary report and analyze the results produced in Part3  
compare the dirrerent timetables(from different algorithms),find out which one would be the most suitable one  
An outstanding list may be included in the report for those tasks cannot be scheduled.
